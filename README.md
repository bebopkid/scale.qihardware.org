Journal of Hardware, Software, Crypto and CHINA.

## Current Week 5 ( date +%w )

## Guideliness

- Weekly Gathering of Links, starts as soon as issue cut on Friday (links held over or cut?)
- Start simple, text file with links in it, anyone may edit, order
- Select top 14 (need some idea of why a number)
- On Friday, end of day PST, compile top links into PDF for release for weekend offline time :)

## Future

- Will add up and down voting on the ranking of link/paper submissions with ETH
- Add some way for sponsorship spots on the issues, paid in ETH

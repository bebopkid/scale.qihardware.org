_Go to the data file, re-order based upon quality, commit
if our proof-of-work right now until can implement
some coin moderation up and down <a href="https://github.com/QiHardware/scale.qihardware.org/blob/master/_data/2019/week/05.yml">Week 05 Links</a> (requires github account)_


<ul>
{% for link in site.data.2019.week.05.links %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ link.url }}">
      {{ link.url }}
    </a><br /><em>posted by {{ link.postedBy }}{% if link.likedBy %}, liked by {{ link.likedBy }}{% endif %}</em>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

## Guideliness

- Weekly Gathering of Links, starts as soon as issue cut on Friday (links held over or cut?)
- Start simple, text file with links in it, anyone may edit, order
- Select top 14 (need some idea of why a number)
- On Friday, end of day PST, compile top links into PDF for release for weekend offline time :)

## Future

- Will add up and down voting on the ranking of link/paper submissions with ETH
- Add some way for sponsorship spots on the issues, paid in ETH

## Old Issues
